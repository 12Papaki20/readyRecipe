Add in the eggs, lightly beaten, the olive oil, and the salt.\nMix with a fork, incorporating a little flour at a time. When the dough starts forming and you aren’t able to continue mixing with the fork, start kneading with your hands.\nFirstly, the dough will stick to your fingers but if you knead it constantly for at least 10 minutes, you will see it thickening and getting the desired consistency. If you want, you can make the dough in the mixer, too.\nWhen it’s ready (it will have a velvety texture and it won’t stick to your hands anymore), wrap it in plastic wrap so that it doesn’t dry, and let it rest for 30-60 minutes.\n\nFor the stuffing\n\n\nIn a frying pan over medium heat, add half of the olive oil. Add half of the asparagus cut into 3 pieces, half of the spring onions, and sauté them for 3 minutes.\nAdd 60 g water, lower the heat, and cover the pan with a lid.\nSimmer for 6-8 minutes, depending on the size of the asparagus, checking regularly that the water is not evaporated.\nAs soon as the asparagus is completely boiled, remove it from the frying pan, add into a bowl and let it cool.\nThen, in the bowl with the asparagus, add the remaining ingredients for the stuffing, and mix well.\nSet it aside until needed.\n\nFor the ravioli\n\n\nCut the dough into four pieces.\nShape one of the pieces into a strip.\nDust your working surface with flour, place the strip, and lightly press it with your fingers.\nAdd flour and roll out the dough with a rolling pin, until you get a very thin and wide sheet.\nCut its edges with a knife to straighten all the sides.\nFold it in half and set it aside, covering it with a tea towel so that it doesn’t dry. Follow the same process for the remaining dough pieces.\nSpread one of the sheets on your working surface.\nUse a spoon to take a little of the stuffing and place it over half of the dough, leaving a 2 cm gap between each spoonful of stuffing.\nWith a pastry brush, spread the egg wash over the dough, around the stuffing.\nCover the stuffing with the other “half” of the empty dough (like folding it).\nLightly press the filling, so that there is no air left inside, and then press the dough well to stick together.\nWith a round 4-5 cm cookie cutter, cut the ravioli into round pieces. At this point, if you don’t want to cook them right away, add them to a baking pan lined with parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap, and put it in the freezer where you can store them for 1 month.\nPlace a pot with water over medium heat.\nAs soon as the water starts boiling, add salt and the ravioli.\nAs soon as they start rising to the surface (in about 2-3 minutes), they are ready; so, remove them from the pot and drain. Put aside 80 g of the water where the ravioli boiled for the sauce.\nAdd the remaining asparagus to the pan -cut into 3 pieces- along with the rest of the spring onions, the olive oil, and the butter.\nSauté for 2 minutes, add the 80 g of water that you put aside, and simmer for 2 minutes.\nAdd the boiled and drained ravioli into the pan with the butter, the olive oil, and sauté them for a few minutes.\nServe the ravioli warm, sprinkling them with a little finely chopped mint and pepper.",

Mix with a fork to combine.\nPlace a nonstick pan over medium heat and let it get very hot.\nIn order to cook the pancakes you need a very small amount of vegetable oil. In order to make sure you have the right amount of oil you will need a potato. Cut the potato in half, pick it up with a fork and dip the cut side into the oil and brush the pan with it.\nUsing a tablespoon, pick up a spoonful of the pancake batter and add it to the hot pan.\nYou can add up to 3 spoonfuls, making sure to leave enough space between them since they will spread while cooking and you don’t want them sticking together.\nOver the first pancake, add 1 tablespoon of blueberry and 1 thinly sliced strawberry.\nOver the 2nd pancake, add 1 tablespoon blackberries and 1 thinly sliced strawberry.\nOver the 3rd pancake add 1 thinly sliced banana.\nYou can create any other combination you like.\nCook for 2-3 minutes, until golden without moving them.\nTo make sure they are ready, lift the edge of one pancake with a spoon.\nFlip them over and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until golden.\nRepeat the same process until all of the pancake batter is finished.\nTo serve, place a pancake on a serving dish, drizzle with honey and top with fresh fruit. Cover with another pancake, drizzle with honey and top with fresh fruit.\nRepeat the same process until all of the pancakes are finished.\nYou can also add some lovely edible flowers.",
